		<div class="infobox"><h1>What is Redline?</h1>
			<p><b>Redline</b> is the product of 7 years-worth of hand drawn animation. Directed by Takeshi Koike, Redline follows the story of JP, voiced by <u>Takuya Kimura</u>, as he seeks to win the underground Redline race, held on the highly militarized planet of Roboworld against its government's wishes. Redline scored a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483797/ratings?ref_=tt_ov_rt">7.5 on IMDB</a>, performing much better than <em>Speed Racer</em>, a live action movie adaptation of another racing anime, which only scored a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/">6/10 on IMDB</a>.</p>

		<div class="infobox"><h2>Plot and Setting</h2>
			<p>Redline, to me, represents the perfect blend of plot and action, managing to deliver a massive amount of stylized action animation, while still building a complex world and relationship between its characters. It develops the world through passing references to places and technologies that imply there's a lot more beyond just what the characters are immediately dealing with, such as previous intergalatic wars, treaties, demilitarized zones, multiple racing commissions, mafias interested in race fixing, a magical race of aliens, hyperspace travel, exotic cuisines, mixing of vastly different alien cultures, and the rivalry of cars with wheels versus newer hover technology.</p>
			<p>In the process of establishing this complex setting, it also manages to establish JP as a character, setting up his motivations, and relationships with Sonoshee, voiced by <u>Yû Aoi</u>, and Frisbee, voiced by <u>Tadanobu Asano</u>.</p>

		<div class="infobox"><h2>Animation</h2>
			<p>With the count coming in at over 100,000 frames, the animation of Redline is an unimaginably spectacular achievement. Every scene has an amazing amount of motion, with the whole character typically redrawn from scratch. The movie features character animation, vehicles, distorted perspective, fighting, special effects, and more, with no apparent use of 3d models or rotoscoping to fill in the gaps.</p>
